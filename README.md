# Welcome to TorpedoRead ðŸ‘‹
TorpedoRead is an innovative browser extension that biohacks your brain into reading quicker with a deeper focus.

## Open Source Initiative.

As of the 12th September 2022, TorpedoRead has been made open source ðŸŽ‰. We will slowly start open-sourcing all our features including our PDF and Ebook converter. We welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the improvement of TorpedoRead by creating bug reports, and/or contributing their own code.


#### Personal Note:

Although I have openly shared the code for my projects in the past, I've never actively maintained and updated open-source software, I've only ever worked in small teams of developers under constant communication. Along with this, I also work on other software full-time and don't have an unlimited amount of spare time. I will be improving the documentation and contributing guidelines as I learn more. You can also contact me on Twitter [@unreleased](https://twitter.com/unreleased) or on Discord unreleased#0001 if you feel this is a project that you are able to better lead than I.


## Contributing

You can contribute by opening an issue or pull request. I will review & test the code and push a new version of the extension to Chrome and Firefox for each iteration.


#### What features can I work on?

You can work on anything you think would be a useful feature, currently some of the key features we're missing are:

- Adding the option to disable TorpedoRead on certain websites along with a page to view those/modify those options.
- Improve the overall design of the extension pages
- Add additional fonts you feel would be beneficial (Such as open dyslexia)


## Firefox & Chrome

When I created TorpedoRead, Firefox did not support Manifest V3, I had to change the code around to work for Manifest V2. Once Firefox starts supporting Manifest V3 we should be able to use a single directory for the whole extension.
